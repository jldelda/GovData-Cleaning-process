For over twenty years the Index has delivered thoughtful analysis in a clear, friendly, and straight-forward format. With new resources for users and a website tailored for research and education, the Index of Economic Freedom is poised to help readers track over two decades of the advancement in economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity and promote these ideas in their homes, schools, and communities.

The Index covers 12 freedoms – from property rights to financial freedom – in 186 countries.","The Heritage Index of Economic Freedom measures economic freedom based on 12 quantitative and qualitative factors, grouped into four broad categories, or pillars, of economic freedom:
1. Rule of Law (property rights, government integrity, judicial effectiveness)
2. Government Size (government spending, tax burden, fiscal health)
3. Regulatory Efficiency (business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom)
4. Open Markets (trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom)

DOTS comprise official data of trade by geographical breakdown reported by country authorities to the IMF, orcollected by the IMF from official sources. Official data are complemented with estimateddata for individual countries that report (or publish) trade statistics with a delay, or do not publish trade statistics by partner country at all. Estimates for these countries are based ondata reported by their trading partners or, when these are also unavailable, on their total level of exports and imports.

The estimation of missing trade statistics based on counterpart trade and other information isa distinctive feature of DOTS. The worldwide coverage of trade (official and estimated) makes DOTS a unique product for users of international trade statistics. DOTS is an up-to-date and comprehensive monthly monitor on global trade, inter-regional dynamics, andcountry-specific directions of trade. DOTS also provides estimates of total trade for late andnon-reporting countries. The IMF regularly uses DOTS for external trade assessment in thecontext of bilateral and multilateral surveillance.","The core method is the regression-based benchmarking model developed by Cholette and Dagum (2006), which is an ideal framework to combine official sources available at different frequencies. The benchmarking method is used to generate monthly estimates that are consistent with officialannual data collected by the IMF, or available from other international organizations. Another fundamental change in the methodology is that monthly estimates of imports and exports are now derived by linking (or splicing) the month-to-month changes shown by the corresponding trade flows reported by partner countries, and not by using their levels adjusted for shipping and insurance costs. This splicing assumption – combined with theadoption of the Cholette-Dagum model – allows to obtain monthly estimates that are aligned with historical records of trade officially reported by individual countries, and avoids breaks in the level of the series caused by bilateral trade asymmetries.","For use guidelines, please consult International Monetary Fund (http://www.imf.org/external/terms.htm)",tc

The OECD has played a key role in the development of international guidelines for surveys of business innovation (Oslo Manual) and the design of indicators constructed with data from such surveys. In addition to developing methodological guidance, the OECD also carries out analytical studies using innovation-related indicators and microdata. This work is guided by the OECD Working Party of National Experts on Science & Technology Indicators (NESTI). The OECD/Eurostat Oslo Manual is currently in the process of undergoing its third revision.","Despite a gradual process of harmonisation based on the Oslo Manual, national innovation surveys still have some significant differences in methodology and design. Regarding the survey forms, this includes the sequencing and wording of questions, the types of variables (e.g. categorical vs. numerical), the filtering of firms throughout the questionnaire, etc. Regarding survey design and methodology, this includes the choice of the target population, the length of the reference period, data collection and processing methods, etc.

timely_indicators_of_entrepreneurship,Timely Indicators of Entrepreneurship,OECD - Timely Indicators of Entrepreneurship,https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TIMELY_BDS_ISIC4,Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),http://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/,"Most of the OECD countries produce data on business demography on an annual basis. Data come from national business registers for statistical purposes, typically managed by National Statistical Offices (NSOs). These statistical business registers are compiled from information from various administrative records and surveys and both the quality and comprehensiveness of the data drawn from them are high. But often quality is achieved at the expense of timeliness, as data processing, cross-checking and control take time. Yet, events such as the global economic crisis demand immediate access to up-to-date indicators. Policy analysts need to understand the impact of such events on entrepreneurship and respond promptly with policy initiatives.

Thus the EIP has supplemented its register-based data with a new set of timely indicators of entrepreneurship. The compilation process focuses on timeliness as the indicators are based on monthly and quarterly data on enterprise creations and failures that are available through the internet. The sources used are among those employed for business registers. For most countries, a single source is exploited; for firm creation it is normally an administrative file or a register from a chamber of commerce; for firm closures, the source is mainly bankruptcy records.","There are two important qualifications concerning the data collected through these alternative sources. First, since a single source is used, rather than the multiple sources used for national business registers, the population of enterprises is often incomplete. Depending on the country, the chosen single source may not cover certain legal forms of enterprises (e.g., sole proprietor) or sectors of activity (e.g. agri-culture or education) or enterprises below a certain turnover or employment threshold. Second, the concepts of enterprise “creation” and “failure” reflected in the data series differ across countries. Some of the national sources selected for the timely indicators use the concept of creation, while others that of enterprise birth. The latter concept is more restrictive as it refers to a legal entity that appears for the first time with no other enterprise involved in the creation process. It excludes firm creations resulting from mergers or changes of name, type of activity or ownership. The notions of failure are also different. The sources may record the opening of bankruptcy procedures or actual liquidations. Finally, attention is drawn to specific data issues in three countries. In France, enterprise creations are recorded at the date of the data treatment and not at the real date of enterprise creation; in Spain, the administrative source includes new enterprises registered but non-active; and, for the United States, new creations refer to establishments and not to enterprises.

To address the issues above, and before their inclusion in the database, a number of adjustments have been made to the series. In addition, the monthly and quarterly data have been seasonally adjusted. Metadata, explaining the characteristics and adjustments made to each single data series, are accessible on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/15/46346883.pdf). Data can be found online in OECD.Stat: http://stats.oecd.org >> Industry and Services >> Timely Indicators of Enterpreneurship

While indicator levels are not strictly comparable across countries in the timely series, comparisons in terms of trends and growth rates are valid. Trends in countries’ adjusted series on firm creation and bankruptcies show a remarkably similar pattern across countries.","For use guidelines, please consult Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (http://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/)",tc

The programme, started in 2006, was the first attempt to compile and publish international data on entrepreneurship from official government statistical sources. From the outset a key feature in the development of these indicators has been to minimise compilation costs for national statistical offices, which is why the programme focuses attention on exploiting existing sources of data.

Informing policy design through the development of policy-relevant indicators is at the core of the EIP programme, and much attention is paid to responding to information needs, including the need for timely information on the situation of small businesses. To that purpose, Entrepreneurship at a Glance features an opening chapter on recent trends in entrepreneurship, discussing the evolution of enterprise creations, bankruptcies and self-employment.

This edition was prepared in the Trade and Competitiveness Division of the OECD Statistics Directorate by Liliana Suchodolska, Gueram Sargsyan, Belén Zinni and Frédéric Parrot. Nadim Ahmad and Mariarosa Lunati provided overall guidance and edited the publication.

Particular thanks go to Eurostat and to experts in National Statistical Offices from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States; and to Cornelius Mueller from Invest Europe, Darrell Pinto from the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association, Maryam Haque from the National America Venture Capital Association of the United States and Kyle Stanford from PitchBook for help and advice on equity capital statistics.","This publication presents indicators of entrepreneurship collected by the OECD-Eurostat Entrepreneurship Indicators Programme (EIP). Started in 2006, the programme develops multiple measures of entrepreneurship and its determinants according to a conceptual framework that distinguishes between the manifestation of entrepreneurship, the factors that influence it, and the impacts of entrepreneurship on the economy. A defining characteristic of the programme is that it does not provide a single composite measure of overall entrepreneurship within an economy. Rather, recognising its multi-faceted nature, the programme revolves around a suite of indicators of entrepreneurial performance that each provide insights into one or more of these facets. Perhaps most important is the recognition within the programme that entrepreneurship is not only about start-ups or the number of self-employed persons: entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial forces can be found in many existing businesses and understanding the dynamism these actors exert on the economy is as important as understanding the dynamics of start-ups or the self-employed.

Indicators of entrepreneurial performance, computed by National Statistical Offices (NSOs), are presented for the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

For each indicator, a short text explains what the indicator measures, how it is defined, and its policy relevance. Additional commentary is provided on the comparability of the indicator across countries.

Data are also presented for the entrepreneurial determinant “venture capital”, while a list of indicators of determinants of entrepreneurship, together with their data sources, is included in an Annex.

GII,Global Innovation Index,The Global Innovation Index,https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator,The Global Innovation Index,https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/terms-conditions#tnc," The Global Innovation Index (GII) aims to capture the multi-dimensional facets of innovation and provide the tools that can assist in tailoring policies to promote long-term output growth, improved productivity, and job growth. The GII helps to create an environment in which innovation factors are continually evaluated. It provides a key tool and a rich database of detailed metrics for economies, which in 2017 encompasses 127 economies, representing 92.5% of the world’s population and 97.6% of global GDP.

The Global Innovation Index 2017 (GII), in its 10th edition this year, continues to be co-published by Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, an agency of the United Nations). The core of the GII Report consists of a ranking of world economies’ innovation capabilities and results. Over the last ten years, the GII has established itself as a leading reference on innovation. Understanding in more detail the human aspects behind innovation is essential for the design of policies that help promote economic development and richer innovation-prone environments locally. Recognizing the key role of innovation as a driver of economic growth and prosperity, and the need for a broad horizontal vision of innovation applicable to developed and emerging economies, the GII includes indicators that go beyond the traditional measures of innovation such as the level of research and development."," The Global Innovation Index (GII) is an evolving project that builds on its previous editions while incorporating newly available data and that is inspired by the latest research on the measurement of innovation. The GII relies on two sub-indices—the Innovation Input Sub-Index and the Innovation Output Sub-Index—each built around key pillars.

Five input pillars capture elements of the national economy that enable innovative activities: (1) Institutions, (2) Human capital and research, (3) Infrastructure, (4) Market sophistication, and (5) Business sophistication. Two output pillars capture actual evidence of innovation outputs: (6) Knowledge and technology outputs and (7) Creative outputs.

Each pillar is divided into sub-pillars and each sub-pillar is composed of individual indicators (81 in total in 2017). Sub-pillar scores are calculated as the weighted average of individual indicators; pillar scores are calculated as the weighted average of sub-pillar scores.

Four measures are then calculated:
1. Innovation Input Sub-Index: is the simple average of the first five pillar scores
2. Innovation Output Sub-Index is the simple average of the last two pillar scores
3. The overall GII score is the simple average of the Input and Output Sub-Indices
4. The Innovation Efficiency Ratio is the ratio of the Output Sub-Index over the Input Sub-Index

The GII gathers data from more than 30 sources, covering a large spectrum of innovation drivers and results; privileging hard data over qualitative assessments (only five survey questions were included in the GII 2017)

The framework is revised every year in a transparent exercise to improve the way innovation is measured.

A positive change in the CIP value of a given country over time indicates increased productive capacity and improved quality of products with a better chance of realization in international markets. A comparison of the CIP across countries indicates the comparative advantage of one economy over others.","The CIP’s major distinction relates to its sector perspective. Industrial competitiveness is defined as the capacity of countries to increase their presence in international and domestic markets whilst developing industrial sectors and activities with higher value added and technological content (UNIDO, 2012). Industrial competitiveness necessitates innovation, technological sophistication, developed infrastructure and effective industrial policy directed at exploiting comparative advantage. CIP is based on output measures and thus captures a country’s production performance.

Another important feature is that the CIP is fully based on statistical measures. While the uniformity of the computation methods and classification standards ensures the international comparability of statistical data, respondents’ business perceptions are difficult to harmonize. Perception indicators are based on the respondent’s individual understanding and are influenced by the time and context of the interview.  As a performance indicator, CIP reflects a country’s productivity, structural change and competitiveness. These concepts are taken as a departure point for the selection of indicators under the three major dimensions of the CIP. 

Subsequently, the major part of the consistency check and imputation process is completed before the construction of the CIP. Nevertheless, the CIP as a composite measure requires figures to be available for all indicators in the given timeframe for target countries. To avoid the exclusion of a country due to missing data, additional imputation may also be necessary. After defining the indicators, the CIP index is constructed based on a standard data transformation process for the composite measure which involves the imputation of missing data, outlier cleaning and normalization. The purpose of normalization is to obtain a common measure from indicators with a value in varying scales. The CIP index follows the Min-Max normalization process, which is particularly useful for obtaining harmonized scores between 0 to 1.

Following normalization of each indicator, the best performing country is assigned a value of 1 and the weakest performing country is assigned a value of 0. The composite measure is subsequently calculated from the individual scores. At this stage, two methodological options are available – weighting and aggregation. The general idea is to distribute equal weights to all indicators and to maintain the balance of the three dimensions. With respect to aggregation, the choice is based on the assumption that indicators are substitutable, i.e. poor performance of one indicator can be compensated for by higher values of other indicators. Aggregation using geometric means limits such compensation to some extent, and thus higher values for all indicators are necessary to achieve an improved CIP.

It is built on trade and production data collected in 178 countries. Symmetric bilateral trade costs are computed using the Inverse Gravity Framework (Nov. 2009), which estimates trade costs for each country pair using bilateral trade and gross national output. Trade costs are available for two sectors: trade in manufactured goods, and agriculture. Energy is excluded.

This is a joint project between the World Bank International Trade Department and the Trade Division at the UNESCAP. ","The ESCAP Trade, Investment and Innovation Division, in support to the ARTNeT research programme on trade facilitation, initiated development of a bilateral trade cost database in 2010 in an effort to increase understanding of the cost of trading between countries in Asia and the Pacific and beyond. The trade cost measure, based on Novy (2012), is a comprehensive all-inclusive measure based on micro-theory and calculated using macro-economic data, providing an alternative measure of trade facilitation performance. Following release of a first version of the database in 2010 using trade and GDP data, an improved and expanded version 2 was released in December 2011 - based on gross output data and providing sectoral trade cost estimates for about 100 countries.

In late 2011, United Nations ESCAP and the World Bank (WB) joined hands to develop a common standard methodology for calculating comprehensive international trade costs and provide the research and policy community with a global reference.

logistics_performance_index,Logistics Performance Index,WBG - Logistics Performance Index,http://lpi.worldbank.org,World Bank Group,http://www.worldbank.org/terms-datasets,"The Logistics Performance Index is an interactive benchmarking tool created to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in their performance on trade logistics and what they can do to improve their performance.  The LPI 2016 allows for comparisons across 160 countries. The LPI is based on a worldwide survey of operators on the ground (global freight forwarders and express carriers), providing feedback on the logistics “friendliness” of the countries in which they operate and those with which they trade. They combine in-depth knowledge of the countries in which they operate with informed qualitative assessments of other countries where they trade and experience of global logistics environment. Feedback from operators is supplemented with quantitative data on the performance of key components of the logistics chain in the country of work.

The LPI consists therefore of both qualitative and quantitative measures and helps build profiles of logistics friendliness for these countries. It measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country and offers two different perspectives: international and domestic.","The first part of the LPI survey (questions 10–15) provides the raw data for the international LPI. Each survey respondent rates eight overseas markets on six core components of logistics performance. The eight countries are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the country where the respondent is located, on random selection, and—for landlocked countries—on neighboring countries that form part of the land bridge connecting them with international markets. The method used to select the group of countries rated by each respondent varies by the characteristics of the country where the respondent is located.

Respondents take the survey online. The web engine for 2014 is the same as the new engine put in place in 2012. It incorporates the Uniform Sampling Randomized (USR) approach to gain the most possible responses from underrepresented countries. Because the survey engine relies heavily on a specialized country selection methodology for survey respondents based on high trade volume between countries, the USR can help countries with lower trade volumes rise to the top during country selection.

The 2014 survey engine builds a set of countries for the survey respondents that are subject to the rule set. After 200 surveys, the USR is introduced into the engine’s process for country selection. For each new survey respondent, the USR solicits a response from a country chosen at random but with nonuniform probability—with weights chosen to evolve the sampling toward uniform probability.

The international LPI is a summary indicator of logistics sector performance, combining data on six core performance components into a single aggregate measure. Some respondents did not provide information for all six components, so interpolation is used to fill in missing values. The missing values are replaced with the country mean response for each question, adjusted by the respondent’s average deviation from the country mean in the answered questions.

The LPI is constructed from these six indicators using principal component analysis (PCA), a standard statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. In the LPI, the inputs for PCA are country scores on questions 10–15, averaged across all respondents providing data on a given overseas market. Scores are normalized by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation before conducting PCA. The output from PCA is a single indicator—the LPI—that is a weighted average of those scores. The weights are chosen to maximize the percentage of variation in the LPI’s original six indicators that is accounted for by the summary indicator. Standard statistical tests, such as the Kaiser Criterion and the eigenvalue scree plot, suggest that a single principal component be retained to summarize the underlying data. This principal component is the international LPI.

To construct the international LPI, normalized scores for each of the six original indicators are multiplied by their component and then summed. The component loadings represent the weight given to each original indicator in constructing the international LPI. Since the loadings are similar for all six, the international LPI is close to a simple average of the indicators. Although PCA is re-run for each version of the LPI, the weights remain very steady from year to year. There is thus a high degree of comparability across the various LPI editions.","For use guidelines, please consult World Bank Group (http://www.worldbank.org/terms-datasets)

It has also been applied to construction of measures of affected trade from the exporter’s perspective as presented in Bown (2013). In constructing a consistently-defined, trade-weighted import coverage ratio, the critical assumption is on the counterfactual growth rate of TTB-affected products during the period that the TTB is actually in place. The assumption maintained here (and as in earlier applications) is the conservative assumption that all of a policy-imposing country’s TTB-affected imports would have grown at the same rate in a particular year t that a TTB is in effect as the average growth rate of imports not covered by TTBs (from all countries) in year t.

There have been a number of minor improvements in the methodology for constructing these data series that make results for the pre-2010 data (presented below and in this update to the Database) different in some instances from the pre-2010 figures first presented in Bown (2011b). These differences result in innovations associated with i) improvements in comprehensiveness of (historically) available TTB policy and import data, ii) implementation of a consistent concordance for import products at the HS-06 level over time, accounting for product reclassifications, and iii) allowance for differences in how different policy-imposing countries may treat the European Union and EU member states under their application of antidumping and countervailing duties, also accounting for changes to the definition of the EU membership over time.","For use guidelines, please consult World Bank Group (http://www.worldbank.org/terms-datasets)

Ending poverty will not be possible without raising the incomes of the rural poor and ending global hunger. What’s more, one-third of the world’s workforce is engaged in the agricultural sector and two-thirds of the global poor work in agriculture. 

In order for agriculture to become a driver of growth and a tool to alleviate poverty, the investments and performance of key players across agricultural value chains—from farmers to large and small agricultural businesses—are vital. Since 2013, Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA) has collected data on laws and regulations that impact the enabling business environment for agriculture. By providing key data on regulatory frameworks that are globally comparable and actionable, EBA strengthens the information base that can be used for policy dialogue and reform.

Policies, regulations, institutions, infrastructure, support services and market conditions together can facilitate agricultural entrepreneurship, increase investment, and enhance market competitiveness and growth. EBA seeks to improve knowledge and understanding of this business environment, which can help governments to establish appropriate regulatory systems that ensure the safety and quality of agricultural goods and services without being overly costly or burdensome on market actors. 

EBA 2017 is the third report in the series, presenting data that measure legal barriers for businesses operating in agriculture in 62 countries and across 12 topic areas. It provides quantitative indicators on regulation for seed, fertilizer, machinery, finance, markets, transport, information and communication technology (ICT), and water. Two overarching themes—gender and environmental sustainability—continue to be included in the report analysis to ensure that the messages developed by EBA encourage inclusive and sustainable practices. This year scoring was piloted for the land topic for 38 countries in which data were collected. The data for the remaining 24 countries will be collected next year and the team will refine the methodology further. EBA also collected data on the livestock topic, focusing on veterinary medicinal products (VMPs).

Two types of indicators have been developed: legal indicators and efficiency indicators. Legal indicators are derived from a reading of the laws and regulations. In a few instances, the data also include some elements which are not in the text of the law but relate to implementing a good regulatory practice—for example, online availability of fertilizer catalogue. Efficiency indicators reflect the time and cost imposed by the regulatory system—for example, the number of procedures and the time and cost to complete a process such as certifying seed for sale in the domestic market. Data of this type are built on legal requirements and cost measures are backed by official fee schedules when available.

EBA is a joint project of the World Bank’s Agriculture Global Practice and Global Indicators Group. The Agriculture Global Practice defines the World Bank’s strategic direction in agriculture, develops and deploys expertise globally, delivers integrated solutions while capturing and leveraging knowledge effectively for maximum development impact needed to end poverty and boost shared prosperity. The Global Indicators Group, which is part of the World Bank’s Development Economics network, produces global datasets that document and explore the relationship between business environment reforms and key development outcomes. The group’s products include the Doing Business report; Women, Business and the Law; Enterprise Surveys; and Subnational Doing Business, amongst others.","Enabling the Business of Agriculture methodology aims at identifying, measuring and examining key regulatory factors that have an impact on agribusiness activity.

Several transparency and accountability mechanisms are studied: (1) Financial Disclosure (income, assets and interests); (2) Conflict of Interest Restrictions; (3) Freedom of Information (openness, access, rights); (4) Immunity Provisions. The data generated by the PAM initiative is useful to governments interested in establishing or modifying their own public accountability systems, to researchers focused on issues of transparency and accountability, and to practitioners involved in governance projects.","The Public Accountability Mechanisms (PAM) initiative compiles data on the legal frameworks for transparency and accountability mechanisms across 91 countries. To ensure the reliability of the data, a rigorous and systematic approach is applied to data collection and analysis. Technical experts from the countries studied are contacted for guidance on the identification of relevant laws, decrees, codes of conduct, and court decisions. Experienced consultants then produce summaries of the legal provisions collected from primary source documents, in the original language where possible.

Following the preliminary analysis performed by consultants, the data is sent to technical in-country experts for feedback on accuracy and relevance. The contributors are intended to have either in-depth legal knowledge of the mechanism being examined in a specific country or expertise in a related field. To minimize both reliability and validity problems, data is also sent to World Bank country offices for internal review.

It is a partnership program, initiated and managed by seven international development partners: the European Commission, International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and the UK's Department for International Development.

PEFA is a methodology for assessing public financial management performance. It provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of countries’ PFM systems. A PEFA assessment measures the extent to which PFM systems, processes and institutions contribute to the achievement of desirable budget outcomes: Aggregate fiscal discipline, Strategic allocation of resources, and Efficient service delivery.","PEFA is a snapshot of PFM performance at the time of the assessment, but the methodology can be replicated in successive assessments, giving a summary of changes over time. PEFA includes 31 performance indicators across the broad array of PFM activities performed by governments. The indicators are grouped under the seven pillars: I. Budget reliability, II. Transparency of public finances, III. Management of assets and liabilities, IV. Policy-based fiscal strategy and budgeting, V. Predictability and control in budget execution, VI. Accounting and reporting, VII. External scrutiny and audit. Each pillar comprises a group of indicators that capture the performance of the key systems, processes, and institutions of government.

Its foreign sections, its bureau in ten cities, including Brussels, Washington, Berlin, Tunis, Rio de Janeiro, and Stockholm, and its network of correspondents in 130 countries give RSF the ability to mobilize support, challenge governments and wield influence both on the ground and in the ministries and precincts where media and Internet standards and legislation are drafted.","The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF. This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated. The criteria used in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information.

To compile the Index, RSF has developed an online questionnaire focusing on the subjects specified above. Translated into 20 languages including English, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian and Korean, the questionnaire is sent to journalists, media lawyers, researchers and other media specialists selected by RSF in the 180 countries covered by the Index. Each country is assigned a score based on the answers provided by these experts and on the figures for acts of violence and abuses against journalists during the previous year.

The WGI are composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources.  These data sources are rescaled and combined to create the six aggregate indicators using a statistical methodology known as an unobserved components model.  A key feature of the methodology is that it generates margins of error for each governance estimate.  These margins of error need to be taken into account when making comparisons across countries and over time. 

The six composite WGI measures are useful as a tool for broad cross-country comparisons and for evaluating broad trends over time.  However, they are often too blunt a tool to be useful in formulating specific governance reforms in particular country contexts.  Such reforms, and evaluation of their progress, need to be informed by much more detailed and country-specific diagnostic data that can identify the relevant constraints on governance in particular country circumstances.

The WGI are complementary to a large number of other efforts to construct more detailed measures of governance, often just for a single country.  Users are also encouraged to consult the disaggregated individual indicators underlying the composite WGI scores to gain more insights into the particular areas of strengths and weaknesses identified by the data.

The WGI are a research dataset initiated by Daniel Kaufmann (Natural Resource Governance Institute and Brookings Institution) and Aart Kraay (World Bank Development Research Group) in 1999.  Pablo Zoido and Massimo Mastruzzi also made major contributions to the development and updating of the WGI.

The 2016 Report covers 144 countries. More than a decade of data has revealed that progress is still too slow for realizing the full potential of one half of humanity within our lifetimes.","The methodology of the Index has remained stable since its original conception in 2006, providing a basis for robust cross-country and time-series analysis.  There are three basic concepts underlying the Global Gender Gap Index, forming the basis of how indicators were chosen, how the data is treated and the scale used. First, the Index focuses on measuring gaps rather than levels. Second, it captures gaps in outcome variables rather than gaps in input variables. Third, it ranks countries according to gender equality rather than women’s empowerment.

The Global Gender Gap Index examines the gap between men and women in four fundamental categories (subindexes): Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival and Political Empowerment.

The main objective of the integrated database is to make it easier for Members and other stakeholders to access the various types of information relevant for services trade policy-making. It is the only database providing such scope of information on trade in services. 

In its four modules (GATS, RTA Commitments, Applied Regimes, and Statistics), the integrated database permits searches by Member, sector, agreement, or source of information.  Search results are presented in summary form, as well as in more detail.  Search results can be filtered across a number of additional criteria.  Further, users can easily switch from one module to another, for example from looking at a particular Member's commitments in a given sector, to relevant commitments in RTAs, and then to related services statistics.

The 2018 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ranks 180 countries on 24 performance indicators across ten issue categories covering environmental health and ecosystem vitality. These metrics provide a gauge at a national scale of how close countries are to established environmental policy goals. The EPI thus offers a scorecard that highlights leaders and laggards in environmental performance, gives insight on best practices, and provides guidance for countries that aspire to be leaders in sustainability.

The EPI is produced jointly by Yale University and Columbia University in collaboration with the World Economic Forum. The 2018 EPI was produced with generous support from the McCall MacBain Foundation and Mark T. DeAngelis.","The EPI is released biennially in even-numbered years. Because the underlying methodology and data change between versions of the EPI, it is not appropriate to treat the scores from each release as a time series. If you wish to assemble longitudinal data on the EPI, historic time series for most indicators are available on the EPI Downloads page.

The EPI attempts to always use the most recent data available for each indicator. Some indicator data have been produced more recently than others, and some data systems take several years to collect data on every country. The baseline score is calculated for different years for different indicators. In general, we try to use data that are ten years prior to the most recent year in which data are available.

The data sources are standardized to a scale of 0-100 where a 0 equals the highest level of perceived corruption and 100 equals the lowest level of perceived corruption. For a country or territory to be included in the CPI, a minimum of three sources must assess that country.

FinStats was created to meet the primary data and benchmarking needs of policy makers and analysts in the financial sector engaged in diagnostic work. As such, FinStats can be used for Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs), Country Assistance Strategies (CASs), Development Policy Loans (DPLs), Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIAs) and other World Bank financial sector analytical work.","FinStats provides a novel yet simple statistical benchmark framework that improves on traditional, ad hoc benchmarking approaches and enhances the comparability of World Bank documents over time and across countries.

The controls include a restrained set of structural factors that can be viewed as external to policy, at least in the short run. The factors fall under these five types:
1. Economic development factors — Clearly, economic development, as measured by GDP per capita, affects financial development, due both to demand effects (the volume and sophistication of financial activity increases with income) and to supply effects (larger, richer economies can achieve economies of scale and benefit from more competition and better infrastructure). To account for potential non-linearities linking economic and financial development, the square of GDP per capita is also included.
2. Population factors — Countries with larger populations can have deeper and more efficient financial systems (a scale effect). Financial services can also be provided at a lower cost in countries with higher population density (a network effect).
3. Demographic factors — Age dependency ratios, that is, the non-working young and old populations, respectively, as fractions of the labor force, are likely to affect savings and lending patterns.
4. “Special circumstances” — Oil exporters may have smaller financial sectors than other countries at similar levels of income, reflecting the fact that oil revenues can boost GDP out of proportion with the country’s overall level of economic and financial development. Offshore financial centers with intensive cross-border operations can have disproportionately large financial sectors. Landlocked countries encounter structural challenges in accessing international markets, which will impact the composition and performance of the real economy, and, as a result, financial development.
5. Time: global cycle — Since all available country-year observations are pooled, temporal patterns that “lift all boats” are accounted for.","For use guidelines, please consult World Bank Group (http://www.worldbank.org/terms-datasets)",tc

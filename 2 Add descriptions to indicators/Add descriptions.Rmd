This file takes as input the GovDataIND file and paste the description of each indicator in it.

At this point, we have a one sentence description for each data source. They are the same for each indicator in the same data source.

### Read files
```{r}
library(xlsx)
Descriptions = read.csv("Descriptions.csv",sep=",", header=TRUE)
Descriptions$Description = gsub('\"','', Descriptions$Description)

GovData360IND = read.csv("GovData360IND.csv",sep=",", header=TRUE)

#View(Descriptions)
#View(GovData360IND)
```

### Merge by Dataset 
```{r}
GovData360IND2 = merge(GovData360IND, Descriptions, by = 'Dataset', all.x = T)
drop = 'Description.x'
GovData360IND2 = GovData360IND2[, !(names(GovData360IND2) %in% drop)]
colnames(GovData360IND2)[32] = 'Description'

#View(GovData360IND2)
write.csv(GovData360IND2, file = "GovData360IND_with_Description.csv")
```

This is code reads the new ranks of the indicators and join it to the IND file. The ranks have been worked separately in excel (see Re-Rank definitive file). The old Rank column is dropped and some of the indicators as well.

```{r Read files}
GovData360IND = read.csv("GovData360IND_with_Description.csv",sep=",", header=TRUE)
library(xlsx)
Ranks = read.xlsx("Definitive Rank.xlsx", 1, header = T)
```

```{r drop old rank_1}

```

```{r Drop indicators in both files}

```

```{r Write file}

```
